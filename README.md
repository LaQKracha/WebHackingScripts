# My Own Created Web Hacking Scripts

Welcome to my collection of custom web hacking scripts! This repository contains various scripts that I have developed to assist with web security testing and ethical hacking. Each script is designed to target specific vulnerabilities or automate certain tasks commonly encountered in web penetration testing.

## Introduction

This project is a collection of scripts I've created to help identify and exploit vulnerabilities in web applications. These scripts are intended for educational purposes and to assist security professionals in testing the security of web applications.
